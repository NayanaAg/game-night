# Reading Log Project Documentation
DESN3035 Assignment 3  
Nayana Agrawal

## Welcome to my project!
This website is a reading log to track the books I read this year. It includes: 
- Every book I've read in 2024 with a clickable modal to see some quick information about it
- A page to get random book recommendations out of the genres I've read this year
- Some simple graphs and charts to show statistics about my books
- Components and functions to extract data from my Library.json and visualize them in different ways


## Notes on getting set up
**This website uses React and Next.js for building pages and managing packages**.

I used a few packages, and some of them are quite complex so it's important to keep note of package conflicts. I made sure each package had a robust community of developers behind it and was actively being updated to make sure my project remains supported in the future.

Packages you will need: 
- [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)
- [RatingDisplay from FluentUI](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-developer-quick-start--docs) (I did not use the rest of their CSS! Make sure you only apply it to the RatingDisplay element)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/guide) for the pie chart and bar graph

All three of these can be installed using npm or through the documentation links above.


## My overall learning process
I had a lot of fun with this project even though I struggled with some of the more ambitious elements. One thing I realized is how easy it is to overcomplicate things for yourself, especially when you start letting npm packages take over your agency as a developer. I got too caught up in things like randomization functions and component design, which started making my code convoluted. **Always return to the basics if you get stuck during a project!** 

## What's coming up for this project
Although this website can stand on its own for now, I have big plans to improve it in the future. I'll be adding more types of graphs and charts to help with data visualization, such as books read each month of the year and all-time favourite genres and authors (once I port over more years of reading data!)  

I'm also going to make the website more than just a static library; there'll be a login page for friends to leave their own reviews and add their data to the stats page for better comparative values. And of course, I'll be reading tons of more books and writing many more reviews.

Thanks for checking out my project!
